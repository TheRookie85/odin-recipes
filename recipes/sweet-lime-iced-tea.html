        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>What's more Southern than sweet iced tea? I've lived in Florida all my life, yet I'm not a huge fan of the overly sweet iced tea that is popular here in the South. My grandma has made this version of lime tea for as long as I can remember and it is the best! </p>
            <p>Not too sweet, and not too bitter, and the fresh lime juice — amazing!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 gallon boiling water</li>
                <li>6 black tea bags</li>
                <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
                <li>4 limes, juiced</li>
            </ul>        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Pour boiling water into a gallon jar over tea bags. Allow to steep for 45 minutes</li>
                <li>Remove and discard tea bags. Stir in sugar and lime juice until sugar has dissolved. Cool to room temperature; refrigerate until cold before serving.</li>
            </ol>
